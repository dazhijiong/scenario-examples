# Step 2: Profile the Application with perf and FlameGraph

In this step we will use **perf** and **FlameGraph** to analyze performance of our containerized Python/Flask app.

---

### 1. Keep the Application Busy

Keep the Flask container running from **Step 1**.

The app already starts a CPU-intensive worker in the background (computing Fibonacci, math ops, hashing).  
So you **don‚Äôt need an external load tool** like `wrk`. The worker itself will keep the CPU busy enough for profiling.

---

### 2. Profiling with perf (CPU FlameGraph)

Find the container‚Äôs active Python processes on the host:

```bash
docker top flask-app
```

You will see output like:

```
UID   PID   PPID  C   STIME   TTY  TIME     CMD
root  5955  5933  97  ...     ?    00:02:11 python app.py
```

- **PID 5955** ‚Üí worker loop consuming ~97% CPU.  

üëâ Always choose the **PID with highest CPU usage** (here `5955`) for profiling.


Run `perf` against that PID to **record stack samples and prepare data for FlameGraph**:

```bash
sudo perf record -F 99 -p 5955 -g --call-graph dwarf -- sleep 30
sudo perf script > out.perf
```

* **`perf record`**

  * `-F 99` ‚Äî sample the process 99 times per second
  * `-p 5955` ‚Äî attach to the process with PID 5955
  * `-g --call-graph dwarf` ‚Äî capture full stack traces using DWARF debug info for detailed function-level profiling
  * `-- sleep 30` ‚Äî run the sampling for 30 seconds
* **`perf script`**

  * Convert the raw `perf.data` file generated by `perf record` into a human-readable text file (`out.perf`), which will later be used to generate the FlameGraph.


Install FlameGraph tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/Flamegraph.git
```


Generate the folded stacks and create the **FlameGraph** visualization:

```bash
./Flamegraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl out.perf > out.folded
./Flamegraph/flamegraph.pl out.folded > flamegraph.svg
```

* **`stackcollapse-perf.pl`**

  * Takes the human-readable `out.perf` file from `perf script` and **‚Äúfolds‚Äù the call stacks** into a compact single-line format that FlameGraph can read.
  * Output: `out.folded` ‚Äî a text file where each line represents one stack trace and its sample count.

* **`flamegraph.pl`**

  * Converts the folded stack data into an **interactive SVG visualization** (`flamegraph.svg`).
  * Each box represents a function; the **wider the box**, the more time spent there. You can zoom and search in the SVG to explore performance hotspots.

Now download `flamegraph.svg`(right click the .svg file and click "download") and open it in your browser. The file is interactive:  

- **Y-axis = Call stack depth**  
  Each row is one stack frame (a function). The **top block** is the function currently executing, and the blocks below are its parents (callers). The deeper the stack, the taller the flame.  

- **X-axis = Aggregated samples**  
  The width of a block shows how often that function appeared in collected samples. A wider block means the function consumed more cumulative CPU time.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: the X-axis is **not a time axis**. Functions are laid out alphabetically after merging stacks, so horizontal position has no chronological meaning.  

- **Colors**  
  By default, colors are only for visual distinction between functions. They do not represent heat, duration, or resource type (unless using a customized palette).  

- **How to read it**  
  - **Wide blocks** ‚Üí functions where most CPU time is spent.  
  - **Tall spikes** ‚Üí deep call stacks, often from recursion or nested calls.  
  - To investigate a hotspot, start at the wide block on top and trace downward to see which functions led there.  


---

### 3. Interpreting the FlameGraph

Typical observations:

- **Wide blocks** = loops or frequently executed functions.  
- **Tall spikes** = recursive functions (e.g. our `fibonacci(n)`), because each call adds another stack frame.  
- **`_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault`** = Python interpreter main loop (expected in Python workloads).  
- **`_PyLong_New`, `PyNumber_InPlaceAdd`** = Python integer object creation and arithmetic.  
- **`[libpython3.9.so.1.0]`** = calls into Python C API.  
---

‚úÖ At this point, you should have produced a `flamegraph.svg` file that visually demonstrates where your Python/Flask app spends CPU time under load.
